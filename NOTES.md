## Generate CryptoKitties 

About CryptoKitties: I assume it's composing scalable vector graphics (SVG), 
see [Hacking the CryptoKitties Genome](https://hackernoon.com/hacking-the-cryptokitties-genome-1cb3e7dddab3) for an article and reverse-engineered remake from 2017 - that's the best (and only?) [open source version](https://github.com/achadha235/cryptokitty-designer) I found.

> Opening up the SVGs it was easy to see the different parts of the kitty...
> Isolating the SVG elements for each of these genes allowed me build a quick
> React.js prototype that was able to render a kitty of any possible phenotype.

The (build in public) next-gen CryptoKitties 2.0 (demo) designer / renderer for the flow (blockchain meowgration) 
is starting up unity in the browser - as far as I can remember, 
see [CryptoKitties v2.0 - From Ethereum to Flow (Blockchain) - Build In Public](https://github.com/cryptocopycats/awesome-cryptokitties-bubble/blob/master/NEWS.md#cryptokitties-v20---from-ethereum-to-flow-blockchain---build-in-public) to try it yourself.

More insights or points to articles, open source projects and more welcome.


PS:  About Cryptopunks:  Cryptopunks works different, that is, with composing 24x24 pixel images on top of each other I assume, 
see [Inside the Punk Art Machinery - How To Generate 10 000 Punks (and Punkettes), Algorithmically - Paint by Numbers](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/programming-cryptopunks/blob/master/03_generate.md) for a (reverse-engineered) open source remake (incl. the pixel images for composing punks).
